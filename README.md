# Intelligent Virtual Shopping Assistant - Recommendation System 
For our project, we built and deployed a recommendation system using a combination of machine learning techniques and a pre-trained BERT model for embedding generation. The system recommends items based on a given item ID and a budget constraint, utilizing a custom-built deep learning model.

# Overview
The recommendation system leverages various machine learning algorithms and techniques to preprocess data, generate embeddings, and build a recommendation model. It is implemented in Python and uses libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit for the web application.  

# Features
* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Embedding generation using BERT
* Recommendation model built with TensorFlow
* Interactive web application with Streamlit
* Error analysis and model evaluation
